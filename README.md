This repo simply contains a .jar generated in Eclipse to be used with libpd.jar for sources.
Then you can attach `libpdSRC.jar` in Eclipse to see the sources for your make-generated `libpd.jar`, like this:

Note that you should follow original `github.com/libpd/libpd` instructions to build a `libpd.jar` file using make and gcc depending on your architecture.
There is also a make-generated `libpd.jar` build for my 64-bit Windows 7 in case anyone wants to try it but I strongly recommend that you build it yourself.
